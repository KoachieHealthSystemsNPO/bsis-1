Developing in Eclipse
---------------------

1. Download Eclipse Indigo 3.7 or Eclipse Juno 4.2 from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.
2. Install Apache Tomcat 7 and integrate with Eclipse (you may follow http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/tomcat-7-with-eclipse.html).
3. Fork and clone the master branch into a local directory.
3. Import 'Existing project' into Eclipse. The master branch contains the required eclipse project files (e.g. .project and .settings/), so you should be able to start working right away.
